How to install and run Beez (for dummies)?
------------------------------------------

I wrote this document because I've had many e-mails from people who have had
problems installing and running Beez. Installing and running Beez is a bit more
tricky, because Beez is not a Windows game. It needs MS-DOS or Windows' MS-DOS mode 
to run correctly. It's a bit confusing, if you don't have a clue, what MS-DOS is.
To run Beez under Windows, you must do the following:

Installing
----------
1.	Download Beez (Beez.zip) from pistegamez.cjb.net/beez
2.	Create a new folder (directory) for Beez (eg. C:\Games\Beez)
3.	Extract Beez.zip using eg. WinZip. 
	Etract the files to the folder you just created (eg. C:\Games\Beez)

It's almost done!

4.	Press Windows' Start button (the one in the down left corner) and select Run...
5.	Press 'Browse' button.  
6.	Select the folder where you extracted the game and choose Msetup.exe
	(eg. C:\Games\Beez\Msetup.exe).
7.	All you need to do is press Enter 6 times.  

Executing under Windows
-----------------------

1.	Right click on you desktop. Choose New - Shortcut.
2.	Press Browse button. 
3.	Choose Beez.exe from the folder you created (eg. C:\Games\Beez\Beez.exe)
4.	Press Next - Next - Finish.
5.	There should be a new icon on your desktop called Beez.exe.
6.	Right click on Beez.exe icon and choose Properties.
7.	Choose Program leaf and there press the "Advanced..." button.
8.	Choose MS-DOS mode. Press Ok.
9.	Double click the Beez.exe icon to run the game. 

	Computer will switch between 
	Windows	and MS-DOS before and after the game, so you will see black text screens
	and other spooky things happening on you screen :)

Have fun!
